# Physics-Website

The purpose of this website will be to not only accrue web development skills, but also to go over techniques of scientific computing done during my physiucs degree. Some of these may include projectile motion with air resistance, solutions to differential equations using Runge-Kutta, planetary motion, random walk simulations, etc. This page will be slowly updated as projects are compeleted or new web development techniques are learned.
